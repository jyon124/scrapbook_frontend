Click above link to visit the website.

The scrapbook is an application that allows users to view the world news on a single website. By sign-in, this website provides more functionality to users. Users will be able to save the preferred selection of news to their own personal page. From each saved news page, users can select the wanted English letters or sentences to be highlighted in various colors. Also, notes can be added to each saved news indefinitely. You can explore the web page by clicking the “Heroku” logo below. It will take some time to load due to the app sleeping.
